# Review Domain Map

Version: 2026-09-11
Status: System-of-record map for Remote Review material, semantic verdicts, and grading.

Use this when a change touches ReviewSubject preparation, aspect prompts,
review-report verdicts, reissue or escalation decisions, or the evidence shown
for a remote grade.

## Review material contract

`runner/RemoteReviewWorkspace.cs` materializes the immutable delivery
Result-SHA in a disposable candidate checkout. Before the first semantic aspect
runs, it freshly fetches the frozen plan's integration ref and resolves the Git
merge-base between that ref and the Result-SHA. It then appends the same
authoritative material to every semantic aspect prompt:

- the integration ref, resolved merge-base SHA, and delivery Result-SHA;
- the changed-file list from `git diff --name-only <merge-base> <result-sha>`;
- the unified delivery diff from
  `git diff --find-renames --unified=3 <merge-base> <result-sha>`.

The semantic prompt must not rely on the review agent discovering this material
with tools. The frozen template created by
`backend/Features/Runner/RemoteReviewPlanBuilder.cs` supplies task and status
context; `RemoteReviewWorkspace` supplies Git evidence from the exact candidate
checkout at execution time. A semantic plan therefore requires an integration
ref even when no build command uses baseline comparison.

The prompt budget is 200 changed files and 12,000 unified-diff lines. Within
that budget the list and diff are complete. When either limit is exceeded, the
prompt contains a visible `REVIEW_DIFF_TRUNCATED` marker stating the shown and
total file and line counts plus the configured budget. Truncation is never
silent.

## Verdict citation contract

Every semantic aspect sentinel supplies these fields:

```text
[[ASPECT_VERDICT: status=<pass|concerns|block>; summary=<sentence>; evidence_checked=<files or sections>; missing=<exact gap, or none>]]
```

`evidence_checked` names the files, diff sections, tests, or result artifacts
the reviewer used. `missing` names the exact absent file, acceptance item,
branch, or contract for a block; pass and concern verdicts use `none` when there
is no missing gap.

`contracts/TaskServer.Contracts/ReviewContracts.cs` owns the shared
`ReviewVerdictCitationPolicy`. A semantic block without both meaningful
`evidence_checked` and `missing` values becomes `concerns` with classification
`block-without-citation`. The standalone Task Server and the monolith-compatible
review endpoint both apply this policy at report admission, so an old or
non-conforming executor cannot bypass it. If no cited block remains, the review
grades as Pass with concerns and the acceptance rail does not reissue or
escalate on the uncited refusal. `orchestrator-engine/CouncilLoop` still records
that verdict in its finding count but explicitly excludes the
`block-without-citation` classification from its blocker count.

Deterministic build and test verdicts are not model opinions. Their command,
baseline SHA, and exact new failures provide their citation and retain normal
blocking behavior.

## Key code and tests

- `runner/RemoteReviewWorkspace.cs`: exact checkout, integration-ref fetch,
  merge-base, bounded review material, aspect parsing, and executor-side
  citation downgrade.
- `backend/Features/Runner/RemoteReviewPlanBuilder.cs`: freezes task context,
  aspect templates, CLI, model, thinking level, and integration ref.
- `contracts/TaskServer.Contracts/ReviewContracts.cs`: verdict wire shape and
  shared citation policy.
- `task-server/TaskServerReviewStore.cs` and
  `backend/Features/Runner/V1ReviewPlaneEndpoints.cs`: authoritative report
  admission and acceptance-rail protection.
- `orchestrator-engine/OrchestrationStageHandlers.cs`: Council records an
  uncited downgrade as a concern without turning it back into a reissue.
- `runner.Tests/RemoteReviewWorkspaceTests.cs`: exact docs-diff visibility and
  explicit truncation coverage.
- `backend.Tests/ReviewGradingPolicyTests.cs`: uncited-block downgrade and cited
  block preservation.
